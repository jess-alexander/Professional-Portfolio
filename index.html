                    <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
                    <div class="half-width"> 
                        <p>I started my journey with tech at the tender age of seventeen by taking a computer science class. I had only wanted to learn more about computers, but to my surprise the class was actually a programming class using Visual Basic! I fell in love with coding and found it came to me quite easily. I dove into programming head first by finishing classes at a local junior college and landing a job programming COBOL before my 20th birthday.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p> In a move I will never regret, I quit my job and moved to Japan to be with my husband who is in the Air Force just six months after starting my new job. Needless to say, my five year career plan did not work out! Seven years, nine countries, and three children later, I'm dying to get back into coding. I've been hard at work studying and practicing my new coding skills and feel ready to take on more projects! </p>

                        <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
                        <p>My focus is writing clean, well formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

                        <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
                        <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>
